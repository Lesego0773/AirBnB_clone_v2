- The user must be able to get a prompt that specifies a certain function e.g To enter their name and surname or password to be able to log in the application.

#####Description of the command interpreter#####

a. How to start it:
- We need clone a repository.
- Most importantly we need to ensure that Python is installed in our operation system.
- Lastly we need to run command interpreter in python

b. #####How to use it#####
- Once the interpreter is running we can use these commands
1. add - adding data into a file
2. list - listing the data in the file.
3. save - saving the existing data 
4. load - loads the data in the existing file
5. exit - exiting the command interpreter.

prompt "Contact added succefully"
